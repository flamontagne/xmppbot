= xmppbot

== DESCRIPTION:

This is a simple implementation on top of StropheRuby 'http://github.com/flamontagne/strophe_ruby/'.
It's for those who want to build xmpp bots quickly. It features only the essential :
- auto accept subscriptions
- callback for received messages
- callback for received presences
- a method to send messages and presences
- That's it

Warning : StropheRuby is quite experimental at the moment. It is definitely NOT ready for production!

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

- Only tested under Debian so far
- Does not work under windows
- No TLS support for now. It will work once TLS with OpenSSL is working in Strophe 'http://code.stanziq.com/strophe'
- Exiting the program can cause segmentation errors (not really problematic)

== SYNOPSIS:

require 'xmppbot'

class Johnny5 < XMPPBot::Bot  
  def connect
    super do |status|
      if status == XMPPBot::ConnectionEvents::CONNECT
        announce_presence
        register_callbacks
      else
        disconnect
      end
    end  
  end
  
  def register_callbacks
    on_presence_received do |pres|      
      puts "#{pres.from} is now #{pres.to_s}" unless pres.to_s.strip == ""
    end
      
    on_message_received do |msg|
      if msg.body == "exit"
        disconnect
      else
        stanza=XMPPBot::Message.new
        stanza.to=msg.from
        stanza.body="You said : #{msg.body}"
        send(stanza)
      end
    end  
  end
end

@bot = Johnny5.new
@bot.jid = "bot@example.com"
@bot.password = "secret"
@bot.log_level = XMPPBot::Logging::INFO
@bot.auto_accept_subscriptions = true

@bot.connect

#We pause the execution of the current thread to prevent the program from exiting
Thread.stop

#Once the parsing thread exits, execution resumes here
puts "Connection terminated"

== INSTALL:

gem install xmppbot (it will install stropheruby as well)
